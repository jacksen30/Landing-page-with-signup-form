# Frontend Mentor - Intro component with sign up form solution

This is my own solution to the [Intro component with sign up form challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-component-with-signup-form-5cf91bd49edda32581d28fd1). I was able to complete this using only HTML and CSS. I felt I was able to get the design looking very similar. I would greatly appreciate any feedback / constructive criticism on how I could refactor any parts of my code, or if there are any places where I have frogotten to use best practices. I built this using mobile first design as to be following Googles mobile first indexing best practices in relation to SEO. 

One new thing I did learn doing this, was how to give form input placeholder text margin by using code such as: 

input[type=text] {
    padding-left: 5%;
}
