# Frontend Mentor - Intro component with sign up form solution

This is my own solution to the [Intro component with sign up form challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-component-with-signup-form-5cf91bd49edda32581d28fd1). I was able to complete this using only HTML and CSS. I felt I was able to get the design looking very similar.

I built the page using mobile first design as to be inline with Googles mobile first indexing best practices in relation to SEO. 

One new thing I did learn doing this challenge, was how to give form input types placeholder text margin by using code such as: 

input[type=text],
input[type=password],
input[type=email] {
    padding-left: 5%;
}

It also was a good refresher on the different form input types such as type="password", as well as client-side form validation using HTML form input attributes such as type="email", minlength and required.


I would greatly appreciate any feedback / constructive criticism on how I could refactor any parts of my code, or if there are any places where I have forgotten to use best practices.
